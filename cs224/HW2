The difference between the two are that the time modified is different.  realfile and hardlink have the same file numeber as they changed together.  although filecopy stayed the same.

after realfile -rwx------
realfile is now only readable, writable and executable by the owner of the file. groups and everyone else cannot read, write, or execute the file.
Q7)
All the results are the same besides for file copy.
Q8)
The size of soft link stayed at 8 bytes where as realfile and hardlink changed size.

Softlink still points to realfile which has the same inode number.  Once realfile was moved to realfile1 the inode number changed as well as hardlink changed with it. 
Although the link count did not change.
